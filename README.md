# N-Queen Problem (C)

This project was developed as part of the final assignment in the "Analysis of Algorithms" course.

## 📌 Assignment Description
- **Objective:** To implement four different methods in the C programming language to solve the N-Queen problem.
- **Modes:**
1. **Brute Force**
2. **Optimized 1**
3. **Optimized 2**
4. **Backtracking**

- **Comparison:**
- The running times of each method were measured and compared with each other.
- For this purpose, the C language's timing functions were used.

- **User Interaction:**
- The program offers the user the option of running only one algorithm or all algorithms together.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** C
- **Algorithms:** Brute Force, Optimization Techniques, Backtracking

## 📊 Outputs
- The running times obtained for each method are shown in tables.
- Comparisons between methods are analyzed graphically.
